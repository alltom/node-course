<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Congratulations! You're well on your way to creating some great web apps with Node.js. This mini-course has covered a lot:

<ul>
<li>Installing Node.js and third-party libraries
<li>Making a web server with Express and extending it with middleware
<li>Using socket.io for real-time client/server messaging
<li>Using AJAX to fetch JSON generated on the server
<li>Stashing data in redis and reading data from PostgreSQL
<li>Authenticating usernames and passwords with Passport
</ul>

<p>It's kind of ridiculous. Still, there's a lot that hasn't been covered. Hopefully the links to the documentation on every page, and your newfound knowledge of the basics will give you some good legs to stand on.


<h2>Continue</h2>

<p>You're done! There are no more files to open! There is nothing more to learn here.


<h2>Really, Man!</h2>

<p>Well, it might be a good idea to try to <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/nodejs" target="_blank">deploy your site to Heroku</a>, who will host tiny sites for free. In addition to following all of those instructions, you'll have to <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/using-socket-io-with-node-js-on-heroku" target="_blank">tweak your socket.io config</a> for it to work.
</ul>
