<h2>Node.js Introduction</h2>

<h3>What's Node.js?</h3>

<p><a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> is a platform for writing network applications (such as web servers) in JavaScript.

<h3>Why Node.js?</h3>

<p>You could be using <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a>, <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>, or <a href="http://php.net/" title="Why would you use this?">PHP</a>. Why write your web server with <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a>?

<ul>
<li><strong>You already know JavaScript.</strong> More or less.
<li><strong>You want to handle many simultaneous connections.</strong> JavaScript's event-driven execution model is well-suited to "real-time" applications like chat and collaborative editors where many people will have connections open to the server for long periods of time.
<li><strong>Node.js is minimalistic.</strong> Node.js programmers tend to make libraries that you can plug into your project, rather than frameworks that you're supposed to plug your project into.
</ul>
